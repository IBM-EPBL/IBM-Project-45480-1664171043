### Why is Python a popular programming language?
- Python is easy to learn : It uses a simplified syntax with an emphasis on natural language, for a much easier learning curve for beginners.
- English-like syntax : Python is suggested as the first programming language to learn due to its English-like syntax.
- Highly productive : First and foremost reason why Python is much popular because it is highly productive as compared to other programming languages like C++ and Java.
- Requires less time : It is much more concise and expressive language and requires less time, effort, and lines of code to perform the same operations.
- Fastest-growing programming language : Python is also the fastest-growing programming language in the world. Its high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented architecture makes it ideal for all types of software solutions.
- Platform independant : Since it functions on cross-platform operating systems, Python can be used to develop a host of applications, including web apps, gaming apps, enterprise-level applications, ML apps, image processing, text processing, and so much more.
- Open-source programming language : Python is a free, open-source programming language that is available for everyone to use. It also has a huge and growing ecosystem with a variety of open-source packages and libraries

### What are the other Frameworks that can be used with python?
- jango : Django is an open-source, full-stack Python framework. It follows the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle. Django comes equipped with a vast line of ready-to-use libraries.
- Pyramid : Another open-source Python framework on our list is Pyramid. It runs on Python 3 and aims to accomplish as much as possible with minimal complexity. Perhaps the best feature of Pyramid is its ability to run well with both small and large applications.
- CherryPy : Any CherryPy-powered web application is a standalone Python application with its own embedded multi-threaded web server and runs on any OS with support for Python. Such an app can be deployed anywhere an ordinary Python app is able to run.
- Dash : Applications designed with Dash are web servers that run Flask and communicate with JSON packets via HTTP requests. Their frontend renders components using ReactJS. Flask plugins can be used for extending the capabilities of Dash.
- Web2py : Web2Py allow users to create dynamic web content in Python, it doesn’t provide support for Python 3. The ticketing system is one of the most important features of the Python framework. The system issues a ticket to the user whenever an error occurs.

### Full form of WSGI?
- WSGI stands for "Web Server Gateway Interface". It is used to forward requests from a web server (such as Apache or NGINX) to a backend Python web application or framework. From there, responses are then passed back to the webserver to reply to the requestor.
- Requests are sent from the client's browser to the server. WSGI forwards the request to the webserver python app, which then returns the completed request back to the webserver and on to the browser
